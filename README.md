using Typescript.

## Built With

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) - A free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

### Installation

1.  Install the project dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2.  Start the application in development mode (which watches for file changes and reloads as needed)
